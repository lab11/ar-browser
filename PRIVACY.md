AR Browser Privacy Policy
=========================

This privacy statement explains what data the app collects, and how that data is used.


Discovery
---------

AR Browser discovers URLs associated with objects in a users physical space. To facilitate this, the app makes use of the device's camera to identify physical objects, virtually-mapped markers, and tags like QR codes. All image and video data processing is performed locally on the device. When a link is discovered, content is fetched from the destination address. 


Website Access
--------------

Like common web browsers, data made available via W3C standards for HTML, CSS, & JavaScript are accessible to opened websites. Additionally, some web pages may request access to the device's Bluetooth radio or inspect the local Wi-Fi network in order to discover and connect with associated objects.



Cached Data
-----------

To improve performance, the app may cache website content, metadata, and other cookies. All of this data is stored locally on the device.
