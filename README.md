AR Browser
==========

AR Browser is a mobile app that uses augmented reality to enable discovery of web content and interfaces in one's physical space.
The app uses the mobile device's camera to find links associated with objects in an environment, displays them in physically-relevant locations, and allows users to open them within the app.
